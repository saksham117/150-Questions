Will be applicable in questions where there are 2 things asked 
    1) Some K elements are required 
    2) We need to find min or max.  
    3) Heap ke saare questions are some sort of sorting questions (reduces complexity from nlogn to nlogk, 
                                                                where k is the size of the heap)
Also if we need to find K smallest 
    - We use maxHeap of size K 

If we need to find K largest  
    - We use minHeap of size K

Basically vice versa
