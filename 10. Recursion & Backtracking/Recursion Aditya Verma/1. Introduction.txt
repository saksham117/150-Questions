Identifying Recursion Questions 
    - We will be given choices and decisions. 

Primary task is taking a decision on what to do. Secondary task, which happens as a result of primary task 
is that inout gets reduced. But our focus should always be on the primary task. Secondary task will happen automatically as 
a result of primary task. 

No of branches in recursive tree is number of choices!
He told t form recursive tree using input, output method, where number of choices is nmber of decisions 
And as we move down a level in tree, we make a choice 

So he is saying 
1) First draw recursive tree(for a smaller and simple example)
2) Write code for that recursive tree 

Do this in the case, when my conventional approach that is base and hypothesis approach does not work. 

As of now, I used to do in opposite way. i.e first write the code and then check it via a tree. 
Lets see which approach turns out to be better 

So whenever we see a question of recursion.
    We try to achieve it in 3 ways and go to the next way only if previous way fails or you are not able t dedecue the solution from it 
        1) IBH (Induction Base Hypotheses Method, jahan par bus input small hopti and choices nahi hoti)
        2) Recursion Trees (jahan choices involve ho jaati hain, starting from q8: Power set of X) 
        3) Choice Diagram
