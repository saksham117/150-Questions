Identification
    - Most of the stack questions have an array.
    - Brute force of questions that should ideally be solved by stacks, will have time complexity n^2,
      But, in this, the second loop will be dependent on first loop 

      for example:

      for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      {
          for(j = 0; j < i; j++ )
          {

          }
      }

      So some sort of dependence on i!!
