// So far we said ki whenever we see sorted array, then apply binary search, right!

// But in some questions, we also have cases when array wont be sorted and still we can apply binary search on it

// However if thats not the case, we are gonna eliminate one half of the solutun and focus on the others
// We will get this cncept once we do Peak element question!
