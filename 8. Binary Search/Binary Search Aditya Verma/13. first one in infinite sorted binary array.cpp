// we are given a binary array in sorted fashion
// and the binary array is infinite

// We need to find the index of the first 1 in the binary array


// i guess two concepts will be used 
// firstly we need to figure out the high index as this is an infinte array

// after having done that, we need to approach the problem as finding the first index where 1 occurs in a sorted array
