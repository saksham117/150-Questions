- Left Scrambled Strings and valid expression for now 

- Maximum Problems covered by Aditya Verma 
- Edit Distance and Min Cost Path : 2 problems for which once we write recursive code, dp can be made using aditya verma approach 

### Another Set ###
Longest Increasing Subsequence  : Recursive approach and dp approach have some difference
But now I found a appraoch that aligns with Aditya verma too!!
Word Break DP  : Recursive approach and dp approach have some difference (Done in Recursion folder)
Longest Palindromic Substring : Here our first apporach does not work directly. Have to add on to it. Other approaches to it 
are quite complex.

### MCM ###
In MCM, 
1) Step is to always calculate low and high 
2) Most of the times low would be 0 and high length() - 1
3) Only in MCM, i was started as 1, coz we had to access arr[i-1]

4) Alwasy k goes from i <= k and k < j (k iss less than j), coz in my second partition i check from k+1. So ck cannot go to j
