// so the next 6 problems are gonna be based on Knapsack

1) Subset Sum Problem
2) Equal Sum Partition
3) Count of Subset Sum
4) Minimum Subset Sum Differnce
5) Target Sum
6) Numer of subsets of given problem

In all these problems, the initialization will be a little differnet

We can think that in Knapsack we were given an item array divided into two
that is weight array and value array.

So it is possible in the incoming problems, the array given to us will only represent one entity.
So if only one array is given, we are gonna consider it like weight array
	
So in any of the problems, where we are given some items and we need to fit them in a container or a bag with a choice 
that we can include that elemnt or not then it will be a knapsack problem
