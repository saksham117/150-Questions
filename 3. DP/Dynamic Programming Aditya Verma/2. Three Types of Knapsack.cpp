// // by solving the knapsack problem we shall be able to solve the following problems
// 1) Subset Sum
// 2) Equal Sum Partition
// 3) Count of Subset Sum
// 4) Minimum Subset Difference
// 5) Target Sum
// 6) Number of sets with given Difference

// we just have to do very minor changes to the main code of 0-1 knapsack

// knapsack problem is of three types
// 1) Fractional Knapsack: This is a part of greedy algorithms
// 2) 0-1 Knapsack: 
// 3) Unbounded Knapsack

// knapsack is basically a bag 
// so we are basically given a few elemnets along with its wieght and value
// along with this we are given W(capacity) , that is the maximum weight the bag can hold
// so the problem is to maximimze the profit/value with the constraint that weight is fixed

// 1) in fractional knapsack, we can place a fraction of a given weight so as to completely fill the knapsack
// 2) in 0-1 knapsack, either the object will go comlleteky or it will not go
// 3) in unbounded, multiple occurences of the weight can be added to the knapsack


// so now if the question asks for choice and optimal solution it can be approached by recursion/dp
