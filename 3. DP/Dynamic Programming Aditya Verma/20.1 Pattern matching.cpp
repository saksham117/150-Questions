// if i am given a text
// and I am given a pattern
// we need to tell whether pattern exists in text or not

// if I calculate longest common substring between the pattern and the text andnits length == pattern.length()
// I will return yes
// as an additional check, I can also calculate whether that longest common string is the pattern itself or not
