// This is a classic shortest path problem.

// Think in terms of a graph. You basically need to add an edge between two words which can be converted into one another. 
// Resulting graph will be unweighted and undirected.

// Which graph traversal algorithm can now help you in computing the shortest path in undirected, unweighted graph?
