Identifying

1) Are you doing repetitive work?
2) Usually works on arrays or strings and more importantly, they would either be subarrays or subtrings(ie contiguous)
3) And there in find largest, count or minimum or something like that 
4) You will be given k, which would basically be the window size.


Types 
1) Fixed Size Window 
2) Variable Size Window (these are more trickier q) 

Differenc btw the 2 with an example 
    - In first we would be given what is the max sum in window of size = k
    - In second, we would be given the sum and we need to find either largest or smallest subarray having that sum
